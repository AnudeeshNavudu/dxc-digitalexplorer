## Prepare
1. Familiarize yourself with the DXC Industry Business Value Framework (iBVF) structure for the client's industry.  
The iBVF is a key asset within DXC as it breaks down the key elements within a target industry.  DXC Digital Explorer leverages the same framework to position key industry trends.   

2. Review the key trends
For the client's primary industry review the most referenced trends within the [Digital Explorer Trends module.](https://digitalexplorer.dxc.com/de)

### Present some initial viewpoints
Digital Explorer includes some introduction material you can use within the client meeting
- [DXC digital Transformation Story](https://digitalexplorer.dxc.com/pb/playbook/597635)
- [DXC New Orleans Digital Transformation Center](https://digitalexplorer.dxc.com/pb/playbook/782289)
- [DXC Key trends for 2020](https://digitalexplorer.dxc.com/pb/playbook/787028)

## Be Relevant
:bulb: Prepare this before the meeting but also plan to run this live with the client

The aim of "be relevant" to map the clients challenges to existing and potential new solutions
