<br>
:information_desk_person: :email: New members receive an email with details of the group and how to access<br>

## Prepare
1. Familiarize yourself with the DXC Industry Business Value Framework (iBVF) structure for the client's industry.  
The iBVF is a key asset within DXC as it breaks down the key elements within a target industry.  DXC Digital Explorer leverages the same framework to position key industry trends.   

2. Review the key trends<br>
For the client's primary industry review the most referenced trends within the [Digital Explorer Trends module.](https://digitalexplorer.dxc.com/de)<br>
a. Select Industry Trends<br>
b. Select the required Industry<br>
c. Select the required sub-industry<br>
d. Review each of the business areas to get a sense of the key trends within each area<br><br>

:bulb: As you load in content into your **workspace**, some of these **trends** should start to appear.<br>

### Present some initial viewpoints
Digital Explorer includes some introduction material you can use within the client meeting
- [DXC digital Transformation Story](https://digitalexplorer.dxc.com/pb/playbook/597635)
- [DXC New Orleans Digital Transformation Center](https://digitalexplorer.dxc.com/pb/playbook/782289)
- [DXC Key trends for 2020](https://digitalexplorer.dxc.com/pb/playbook/787028)

## Be Relevant
:bulb: Prepare this before the meeting but also plan to run this live with the client.<br>

The aim of "be relevant" to map the clients challenges to existing and potential new solutions

![image](images/relevant.png)<br>


:bulb: Suggested material

- Annual reports
- Strategy paper
- Digital transformation related press releases

:bulb: Create a separate **Workspace** for each type of content - This will allow you to **Compare** workspaces


### Reading in content

You can **Read in** content from either a **Local document** or a **web address**

:point_right: ![image](images/readContent.png) <br><br>
  Select either **Read Webpage** or **Read Document** from the toolbar

### Comparing content
The DXC Digital Explorer team have loaded in a number of key assets into the Digital Explorer solution, this information can be used as a reference point against your workspace content.<br>

**Examples**
- Compare a clients annual report against a DXC industry primer document
- Compare a clients annual report against a DXC Digital Directions paper

:point_right: ![image](images/views.png)<br><br>
Select **Compare** from the **Views** section from the toolbar<br>
![image](images/Compare.png)<br>

:bulb: You can compare you to 3 workspaces<br>
:bulb: You can search to filter the list of available workspaces<br>
:bulb: You can compare against any workspace you are a **member** of and any **public** workspaces shared by your peers<br>
<br>
:art: Example of a comparison between a client's investor report and one of the DXC digital direction papers

![image](images/CompareExample.png)<br>
:bulb: You can click on any section to zoom in<br>
:bulb: Selecting any idea will update the information panel<br>

### Shared Connections
If you have included multiple documents within the same workspace, you can show a client the relationships between the key points and each document.

:point_right: ![image](images/views.png)<br><br>
Select **Graph** from the **Views** section from the toolbar<br><br>

Example of a Graph view..<br>
:art: ![image](images/GraphView.png)<br>
:bulb: You can adjust the size based on number of **relationships** or **matches**<br>
:bulb: Selecting any idea will update the information panel<br>


### Finding solution
After you have loaded or added content into your Workspace you can use the information to find any existing solutions which match the requirements captured.<br><br>
From the bottom Dock, select **Suggested Content**<br>
![image](images/dock1.png)<br><br>

:bulb: You can filter against **solutions** types and **industries**<br>
![image](images/filter1.png)![image](images/filter2.png)<br>
:bulb: You can select to show or hide **People** or **Solutions** within the results set<br>
:bulb: A single click on a Solution card will show the name and elevator pitch within the information panel<br>
:bulb: From the information panel you can select to **Learn more** about the solution, whereby a new tab is opened with the full solution datasheet<br>
![image](images/SolutionPanel.png)<br>
:bulb: You can **Drag and Drop** any card from the **dock** into your **Workspace**<br>


#### Solution Filters
Some example solution filters

- To show any **DXC demos** : Select **Solution Type : Standard Solution**  and **SubType : DXC Demo**
- To show any **DXC offerings** : Select **Solution Type : Reference Datasets**  and **SubType : DXC Offering Family**
- to show any **Client production solutions** : Select **Solution Type : Accelerated Solution Development**<br>
  :bulb: For production solutions use the **SubType** filter to refine the type of solution, e.g. **MVP**, **Pilot**, **Production** <br>

<br>


### Publishing your results

As you walkthrough your **Workspaces**, **Comparison** and **Graph** views, you may wish to publish and share these with the client or account team after the workshop; these can be published using the **Digital Explorer Playbook module**.

:bulb: You may also want to prepare a **Playbook** before the workshop and use the **Playbook** to help with the client discussion

:bulb: You can create a **Playbook** directly within your **Workspace** or **Workgroup**<br>

:bulb: In order for a **client** access a **Playbook**, they must first register on the Digital Explorer platform<br>

:bulb: All playbook contacts can gain insights into the number of views and users of their playbooks, this is available via the **My Playbooks** menu item<br>

#### Creating a Playbook within a Workspace
Within your **Workspace canvas** select the "Send To" option from the toolbar<br>

:point_right: ![image](images/WorkspacePlaybook.png)<br><br>
