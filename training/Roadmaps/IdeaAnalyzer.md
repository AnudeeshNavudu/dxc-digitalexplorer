### Matching Logic
Each item is matched against 3 data points<br>

1. Business Goals
2. Business KPIs
3. Trends (Business and Technology)

The detailed view of a selected item will give you a breakdown of the matches made, plus:
1. Elements not matched from your selected item
2. Additional elements which are not included within your source idea


:bulb:  If the matched ideas has a Solution model associated to it, this is highlighted with the `link` icon within the solution card.<br>
