# Digital Explorer : Roadmaps 
## Before you begin

- Are you assigned to an account<br>
:bulb:  **You must be assigned to an account in order to view or create an Roadmap**<br>
If you are not assigned to an account contact your regional lead <br>
- Have you prepared your **Account Business Value Framework**?<br>
The roadmap module uses a lot of the information from the Account business value framework (aBVF), such as client goals and KPI's
