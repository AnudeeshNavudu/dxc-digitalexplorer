# DXC Digital Explorer | Trends - Submitting your trends

## Before you begin

- Think about the business area and the industry use case
- Are you adding a new trend and industry use case?
- Are you adding a new use case to an existing trend?    

The DXC Digital Explorer trends model is split into 2 section.

1. The general information about the trend
2. The detailed industry use case for the trend

A single trend can have multiple industry use cases
