## Setting up your workspace

Workspaces are organised by groups.   You can create a new group or become a member of an existing group.

1. Access the DigitalExplorer site
     - https://digitalexplorer.dxc.com/dew
     <br>
2. If not already in the `Workspace` module change to the solutions module via the `appblock` in the header
