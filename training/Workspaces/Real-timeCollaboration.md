# DXC Digital Explorer - Workspace real-time collaboration

_Released Feb 2019_
<br>

DXC Digital Explorer workspaces allows members of a Workspace to work in real-time; whereby each member can clearly see which other members are online, receive all updates in real-time and also **present and highlight** cards within the workspace to show other online members key focus areas during the discussions

## Online Members
As each member of a workspace joins, the information bar informs other online members when the person joins<br>
